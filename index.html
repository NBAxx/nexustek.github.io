                                NexusTek’s Cybersecurity Solutions plans concentrate on a business’ most vulnerable and highest risk asset: the users. From cloud email security to cybersecurity awareness training, our plans prepare and protect your users from social engineering attacks meant to manipulate them into revealing sensitive information. Our Cybersecurity Solutions detect, protect, and remediate your business from security threats.

                                Our <b>Essential Plan</b> is the first step to protecting your business from cybercriminals. As part of the managed protection service plan, NexusTek engineers monitor your business’ systems for threats 24/7/365. If a security breach occurs, we notify your company immediately and offer incident response and remediation services on an ad hoc basis. Managed endpoint security software safeguards endpoints or end-user devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, from malicious actors attempting to access the network. NexusTek partners with Barracuda Sentinel, an autonomous AI endpoint security platform, to analyze user behavior and identify abnormal actions from cyber threats. Cybersecurity Essential Plan includes managed cloud email security per user with Barracuda Total Email Security to shield employees from unwanted and/or malicious emails. Each year, NexusTek’s technical consultants perform a security review to assess your business’ security posture and recommend tailored solutions to improve the health of your cybersecurity.

                                Our <b>Standard Plan</b> defends your business from cyberattacks and tackles any cyber threats that do happen to breach the barriers. NexusTek’s managed protection and response plan builds on top of the features from the Essential Plan, still including 24/7 monitoring and alerting, managed endpoint security and patching, and the annual security review. The Standard Plan enhances your business’ cybersecurity with managed DNS security, providing Cisco Umbrella’s cloud-delivered enterprise network security to determine if a user’s web destination is safe or authorized before accessing or denying the website address. Cybersecurity awareness training empowers employees to identify, avoid, and report social engineering attacks. A quarterly vulnerability scan of the network edge per site identifies known exploits or outdated versions in your IT systems that cybercriminals can compromise. NexusTek’s IT consultants work with your organization to understand the ins and outs of any cybersecurity questionnaires your business may receive from potential clients or vendors and properly fill it in to generate revenue or lower your insurance premium. And if a security breach occurs, rest easy with incident response and remediation services included in the plan.

                                Our <b>Advanced Plan</b> is a robust managed detection and response plan that provides comprehensive cybersecurity. In addition to the features of the Essential Plan and Standard Plan, NexusTek increases the frequency of security health checks from annually to quarterly and vulnerability scans from quarterly to monthly, ensuring your business’ systems stay protected throughout the year. Your business will receive a final report of recommended steps to pinpoint open ports and eliminate weaknesses in your IT systems. Our incident response and remediation (IRR) services quickly verify threats, isolate the impacts, and eradicate security breaches. The ultimate feature of the Advanced Plan is the managed SIEM or Security Information and Event Management, which collects log data from multiple sources, including networking devices, servers, appliances, virtual machines, and other infrastructure, into one cohesive platform where AI analyzes it for malicious activity. NexusTek’s Advanced Plan includes unlimited cybersecurity log correlation and aggregation to maximize a business’ ability to detect threats and threat patterns, shore up the corresponding security gaps, and improve incident response and remediation practices. A 24/7/365 Security Operations Center (SOC) is on call to immediately address alerts and protect your business at all hours of the night.
